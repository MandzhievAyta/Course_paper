  A search on "tools to evaluate the quality of writing" often gets you to sites assessing only one of the qualities of writing: its readability. Measuring ease of reading is indeed useful to determine if your writing meets the reading level of your targeted reader, but with scientific writing, the statistical formulae and readability indices such as Flesch-Kincaid lose their usefulness.
  In a way, readability is subjective and dependent on how familiar the reader is with the specific vocabulary and the written style. Scientific reader is with the specific vocabulary and the written style. Scientific papers are targeting an audience at ease with a more specialized vocabulary, an audience expecting sentence-lengthening precision in writing. The readability index would require recalibration for such a specific audience. But the need for readability indices is not questioned here. "Science is often hard to read" (Gopen and Swan, 1990), even for scientists.
  Science is also hard to write, and finding fault with one's own writing is even more challenging since we understand ourselves perfectly, at least most of the time. To gain objectivity scientists turn away from silent readability indices and find more direct help in checklists such as the peer review form proposed by Bates College, or scoring sheets to assess the quality of a scientific paper. These organise a systematic and critical walk through each part of a paper, from its title to its references in peer-review style. They integrate readability criteria that far exceed those covered by statistical lexical tools[2, 3]. For example, they examine how the text structure frames the contents under headings and subheadings that are consistent with the title and abstract of the paper[1]. They test whether or not the writer fluidly meets the expectations of the reader. Written by expert reviewers (and readers), they represent them, their needs and concerns, and act as their proxy. Such manual tools effectively improve writing (Chuck and Young, 2004). Just for test: It is obvious that bla-bla, There is no doubts that Gopen(2000).
One of the biggest challenges in automatic speaker recognition is obtaining invariance across varying operating conditions, while retaining maximum speaker variability.
Different handset type, transmission line/coding, and background noise are typical factors, which lead to signal mismatch across training and recognition. For a speaker recognition system to be useful in practice it needs to be optimized against the mismatch problem.

State-of-the-art text-independent speaker recognizers use mean subtraction at the utterance level, often referred to as cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) in the context of cepstral features. The assumption in mean subtraction is that all the feature vectors have been translated by an unknown channel-dependent vector. By subtracting the mean from both the training and testing vectors, the matching is less affected by this bias. For clean data (no channel mismatch), CMS degrades accuracy.

A general affine channel/environment model includes rotation and scaling of the feature vectors in addition to the additive bias.
